                                Social inclusion, to make people feel they belong, to value diversity,  is a challenge with 
                                    which today’s society is faced. The Municipality of Rotterdam, and the Municipality of The 
                                    Hague, embrace this challenge as an essential element of social resilience. This research 
                                    project at TU Delft focuses on the design of meaningful social interaction through collective 
                                    activities initially within and together with the Municipality of Rotterdam, followed by a 
                                    comparable setting in the Municipality of The Hague.

                                    To foster collective activities, this research project will design online games for social 
                                    play in public spaces. Multi-player online games are, by nature, collective activities. 
                                    “Games as social play” are games designed for individual gaming experience plus social 
                                    experiences - a means to design for engaging social interaction. As such, this research 
                                    project addresses the main question: “Can multi-player online games be designed for meaningful 
                                    social interaction in public spaces?”.

                                    This research project will, in a first step, study the types of requirements that need to be 
                                    met for such game to be played successfully in public spaces, for positive social impact. While 
                                    continuously refining stakeholder requirements, technical requirements and other design 
                                    requirements, the following step consists of designing and evaluating a multi-player online 
                                    game designed to meet these requirements. After collecting data from game play, this research 
                                    projecy will analyse the performance of the system, to identify best practices that really 
                                    support sustainable engagement when multi-player online games are considered for social play 
                                    in public spaces. The tentative outcomes of this project are therefore: 1) a dynamic list of 
                                    requirements to be taken into account while developing a system for sustainable engagement in 
                                    public spaces, 2) a system design that fulfils these requirements, and 3) a conceptual frame 
                                    for system design, including game elements supporting sustainable engagement the best in public 
                                    spaces.
