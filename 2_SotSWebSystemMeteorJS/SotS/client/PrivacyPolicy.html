                                login: 1) email, 2) public profile, and 3) user friends.

                                address. This permission is approved by default by Facebook.
                                <br />
                                2) Public profile: Provides access to a person's basic information, including first
                                name, last name, profile picture, gender and age range. This permission is approved by
