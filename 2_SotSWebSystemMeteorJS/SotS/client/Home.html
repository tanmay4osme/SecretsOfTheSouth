                         “Secrets of the South” is a different approach to social interaction. It is a serious
                         game that will let you walk around your neighbourhood and other public spaces, engage
                         with people you have never met before, and solve challenges together with them to advance
                         throughout the game. Challenges are purposefully placed in specific places, or simply
                         provide an amazing opportunity for you to do something together with someone else. You
                         will walk around, visit places you might have never seen before, and create connections
                         with other people you would otherwise never speak to.
         
                     </p>
                     <p class="description" style="color: white;">
                         Why bother? The overall purpose of the game is to make you happier, healthier, wiser, and
                         to give you even more friends. We want you to have fun while playing a game, get to know
                         your neighbourhood and explore real places, present yourself to the world, and give you
                         an excuse to engage and befriend new people. The places might be related to the history
                         of the city (e.g. the birth of a legend), have played an important role throughout
                         history (e.g. the biggest port in the world), or be home to a local star that should be
                         known. The game will propose initial challenges of different types for you to do (e.g.
                         puzzles, quizzes, augmented reality, or with IoT, to name a few), and you will need to
                         collaborate with other people to solve them. And yes, while walking around…
                     </p>
                     <p class="description" style="color: white;">
                         Let's have fun together! Once players started solving challenges and getting a feeling of
                         the game, they can use this platform to design their own challenges for other players like
                         you to solve. Do you think you can solve the challenges and meet all the people
                         playing the game?
